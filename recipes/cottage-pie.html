    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour, Italian seasoning, and cinnamon. Stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Combine beef broth and tomato paste together in a jug; add to beef mixture. Season with salt and pepper; lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place diced potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with water and place over high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes; drain. Mash potatoes until smooth, then add milk and butter; whip until fluffy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; spread mashed potatoes on top and sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until top is browned and cheese is bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
